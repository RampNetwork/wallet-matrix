# Wallet Matrix

Wallet Matrix is an easy tool to test cross-compatibility between various Ethereum wallets.

Expect it to break randomly - the code is pretty much hackathon quality.

Huge thanks to Noah Zinsmeister for developing web3-react that made making this easy. Much of this project's code is also forked from web3-react's codesandbox demo.
